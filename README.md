Objectives:
To analyze the frequency response of an RC low-pass filter by generating sine waves at multiple frequencies, measuring input and output voltages, calculating gain, and plotting gain versus frequency with a logarithmic scale.

Steps Followed:
1. Utilized WaveForms Wavegen to produce sine wave signals at selected test frequencies.
2. Observed and recorded the input and output voltages using the WaveForms Scope.
3. Computed the gain (in dB) for each frequency based on the measured voltages.
4. Created a Gain vs Frequency plot (dB vs Hz) using a logarithmic frequency axis in Excel.
5. Compiled and organized all the recorded data, graphs, and supporting files systematically.
6. Established this GitHub repository with a clear folder structure to document the entire workflow and ensure version tracking.

Key Observations and Findings:

The RC low-pass filter effectively passes low-frequency signals with negligible attenuation.

As the frequency increases, the output amplitude decreases, demonstrating the expected roll-off behavior of a  filter.

The results align well with theoretical predictions, confirming the expected performance of an RC low-pass circuit.
